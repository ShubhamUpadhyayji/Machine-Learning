Learning Objective:
1) What data analysis is ?
2) Explain the relation between data analysis and ML.
3) Explain the types of data analysis

Input ---  Machine learning --- predicting future event
 
Data analysis :
Is the process of studying the available data and drawing valueable insights or information from it with the help of any software 

Some commonly used analytical tools
1) Python 2) R 3) SAS 4) SPSS 5) MATPLOTLAB

What ML what to do with data analysis
-- Machine learning using different algorithm to predict the future event
-- Data analysis is about analysing data and bringing out valuable insights from it using analystical tool.
-- Data analysis is a part of machine learning which nanlyses your data and bring out insights before applying any algorithms on it.


Exploratory data analysis:
1) To find the patterns and relationships among the data variables.
2) It helps in finding out pattern and trends in the data.
3) EDA give the summary of the data set.

------
Which variable will we deal with ?
 
 EDA let us know about the dataset and hence the modeling becomes easy.
 
 Summarise: 
 Machine Learning --- Algorithm(Models) --- Data analysis --- EDA Graphs Statistics
 
 There are 4 Types of Data Analytics 
 1) Descriptive analysis (What happened)
 2) Diagnostik analysis (Why did it happen)
 3) Predictive analysis (What will happen)
 4) Prespective analysis (What should we do)


Example : Cricket matches 
Available data 
1) Descriptive Analysis -- Which player perform well and help in winning the match
2) Diagnostic Analysis -- 1) What was the main reason for the outcome of the match ?
                          2) was it the toss or pitch condition or player did not work well
3) Predictive Analysis -- will we win the next match 
4) Prespective Analysis -- Which thing should we avoided of focused on to win the next match
