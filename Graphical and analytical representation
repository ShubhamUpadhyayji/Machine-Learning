Learning Objective:
1) What data analysis is ?
2) Explain the relation between data analysis and ML.
3) Explain the types of data analysis

Input ---  Machine learning --- predicting future event
 
Data analysis :
Is the process of studying the available data and drawing valueable insights or information from it with the help of any software 

Some commonly used analytical tools
1) Python 2) R 3) SAS 4) SPSS 5) MATPLOTLAB

What ML what to do with data analysis
-- Machine learning using different algorithm to predict the future event
-- Data analysis is about analysing data and bringing out valuable insights from it using analystical tool.
-- Data analysis is a part of machine learning which nanlyses your data and bring out insights before applying any algorithms on it.


Exploratory data analysis:
1) To find the patterns and relationships among the data variables.
2) It helps in finding out pattern and trends in the data.
3) EDA give the summary of the data set.

------
Which variable will we deal with ?
 
 EDA let us know about the dataset and hence the modeling becomes easy.
 
 Summarise: 
 Machine Learning --- Algorithm(Models) --- Data analysis --- EDA Graphs Statistics
 
 There are 4 Types of Data Analytics 
 1) Descriptive analysis (What happened)
 2) Diagnostik analysis (Why did it happen)
 3) Predictive analysis (What will happen)
 4) Prespective analysis (What should we do)


Example : Cricket matches 
Available data 
1) Descriptive Analysis -- Which player perform well and help in winning the match
2) Diagnostic Analysis -- 1) What was the main reason for the outcome of the match ?
                          2) was it the toss or pitch condition or player did not work well
3) Predictive Analysis -- will we win the next match 
4) Prespective Analysis -- Which thing should we avoided of focused on to win the next match

Part 2:

Learning Objective:
At the end of this topic you are able to 
1) Advantages of representing data graphically
2) List and explain the major types of graphs used for data analysis 


Graphical representation of data :
1) Is the one of the simplest way of drawing insights from the data 
2) Help us to study the relationship between the variable 
3) help to understand the trend and pattern across the variable


## Major types of graphs commonly used for data analysis 
1) Line graph 2) Bar graph 3) Histrogram/frequency polygon 4) pie chart 5) Scatter plot 6) Box and Whisker plot 7) Time series 

If data is not normally distributed we use mathematical treatment to make the data model ready so that it follows a normal distribution.

---***Scatter plot is very useful in informing us the relationship between two variables.

---*** Box plot is also known as box or whisker plot, is a graphical representation of the statistical summary of numeric variables.
( Minimum values ,1st Quartile 25%,2nd Quartile 50%,3rd Quartile 75% values,maximum values , out of maximum or minimum is outliers
** Interquartile range lies between 1st to 3rd quartile**** )
-------Quartile devides the data into three equal parts---------

Time series:
Time v/s some varying quatity

1) Types of graph used impacts your understanding of the data .
2) Be careful hoe you are representing the data and type of graph used.
