Learning Objectives:
By end of this tutorial you are able to :
1) List advantage of using python as a machine learning tool.

Some of commonly used Machine learning tools are :
1) Python 2) R 3) SAS 4) KNIME 5) MATLAB

Python uses:
1) GUI Appliaction(Graphical user interphase)
2) Web application
3) In ML such as face recognition
4) Object Detection
5) Sntiment analysis 
6) product recomendation Engines 


Advantages of python:
1) Object-oriented programming laguage 
  a) allow to create and used objects and class easly.
  b) Example : A variable with whole number is an object of the int class 
2) Compatible with different platforms like windows , mac , linux , Raspbarry pi etc.
3) Simple syntax 
4) Interpreter based laguage 
5) Robust standard libraries 
  a) allow to add funstionality to the program without writing additional code.
6) Integration with 3rd party module 
  a) Cost effective and time saving 
  b) Example: PySpark (Integration with spark)
7) Open source and huge community support.

Jupyter Notebook IDE 

Learning Objective : 
1) List the advantage of using jupyter notebook as IDE (Integrated developement environment)
2) Download jupyter notebook for window & Set up jupyter environment 

Python is not enough we need ide for save code and files 

Defination of IDE: An IDE is integrated developement environment) is a software suit that consolidate the basic tools that developers 
need to write and test the software .

Some important IDE used for python is 
1) Jupyter notebook
2) Anaconda spyder 
3) PyCharm
4) Windows IDE 


--------Advantages of jupyter notebook---------------
1) Versatile and sharelable 
2) Visualisation ability in the same window 
3) Open source web application 
4) A collection of codes , documents and visualisation at one place 
5) One stop shop for data cleaning , data visualisation , building , training machine learning model etc.
6) ability to execute a specific part of the code without having execute the entire code .


------The minimum configuaration required for it-------
Processing speed (Core i5 with 2.59 GHz or Higher ) 
Ram memory 8GB
Disk space of minimum 2-3 GB
Operating system window 8 or higher

Two way of installing 
1) Using anaconda 
2) Download python upgrading pip3 and then installing jupyter notebook.
