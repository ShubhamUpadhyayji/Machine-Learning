Learning Objectives
At the End of this topic you able to 

1) Define Machine Learning 
2) List few application of Machine learning used in your daily life

Defination of machine learning: ** Machine Learning is the ability of machines that is computers to learn and improve from their past experience or data without being explicitly programmed.**

Few application of machine learning in day to day life:
1) Facebook News feed
2) Facebook photo auto-tagging feature
3) Product recommendation by shopping portal

Advance application of Machine Learning
1) Identifying frauds in Banking
2) Sentiment analysis 
3) Amazone GO
4) Chatbots
5) Self Driven Car

How Mchine learning works

Learning Objective: 
1) Explain data and its role in machine learning
2) Explain what is machine learning model and how it interact with the data to make prediction and recommendation.

What is data?
Definition of data: Any information about any things term as a data.
Ex: Specification of smart phones, Messages and comments on social media platform

Data may be anything surrounds us text, number, audio, video anything

""" Data is a heart of machine learning """

In computer ---> Input -- program -- Output
In Machine Learning ---> Data -- ML Model -- Intelligence

Past Data --- ML Model --- Intelligence --- New Data --- Predictions / Recommend action

Different Types of machine Learning
Learning Objectives
1) Define the tern labelled data Unlabelled data
2) Explain supervised learning and unsupervised learning

Commonly Used machine Learning Models 
1) Supevised Machine Learning 
2) Unsupervised Learning

Definitation of Labelled Data: The data which contains a target variable or an output variable that answers a question of interest is called labelled data.

Definition of Unlabelled data: Unlabelled data is one in which contains informations about something but does not have predefined target variable.

Supervised learning: 
-------------------
-------------------

1) From the term supervised learning we can infered the supervised learning model is the model which learned under supervision this supervision is provided by the labelled data which contains a target variable and few independent variable.
2) In supervised learning model we are more interested in the target varible (values) 
3) Example: Lets we have lablled data of customer from e-commerce website 

Discrete variable --- categorical values in a varible
Contnuous varible --- continuous values in a variable

Supervised Learning further devided into two parts
1) Classification Model (Target varible -- category varible)
2) Regression Model (Regression model -- Continuous varible)

Unsupervised Learning:
---------------------
---------------------

1) Complement of supervised learning
2) There is no target variable involved 
3) Works only on unlabelled data
4) Identifies if some pattern involved in the data 

Example: Population data 
We have input varible such as Data survey, district, etc

Unsupervised learning:
The machine learning that is deployed to find patterns in unlabelled data is reffered to as unsuopervised lesrning
